# Just The Rip — Jewels-Only Pack Opening Platform (MVP)

## Overview

**justtherip** is a Jewels-only digital pack-opening platform for collectible trading cards (e.g. Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon). Users purchase non-withdrawable site credits ("Jewels"), open randomized digital packs, and receive physical cards shipped on-demand from third-party marketplaces.

This repository contains the **Phase 1 MVP** implementation.

> ⚠️ This project intentionally excludes cash-out, withdrawals, P2P trading, and inventory warehousing.

### Frontend

- **SvelteKit** (file-based routing)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind / CSS utilities (optional)

### Backend

- Secure server-side RNG
- Idempotent transactional endpoints

### Database & Auth

- **Supabase**

  - PostgreSQL

## Development Rules (Important)

- ❌ Frontend must **never** mutate wallets, packs, or cards directly
- ✅ All state changes happen via Node.js API
- ✅ All money-like operations are transactional
- ✅ All pack opens are idempotent
- ✅ Wallet balances must never go negative

If a feature violates any of the above, it does not belong in Phase 1.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
```

Never expose the service role key to the client.

---

## Local Development

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Start the dev server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

---

## Build

To create a production build:

```sh
npm run build
```

To preview the build:

```sh
npm run preview
```

## Security Notes

- All wallet mutations are server-side only
- Supabase RLS restricts user access to their own data
- Logs are append-only
- No deletes on financial tables

---

## Non-Goals (Explicit)

- No withdrawals
- No cash-out
- No P2P trading
- No inventory warehousing
- No gambling terminology in UI

---

## Phase 2 (Future)

- Additional pack types
- Multi-game expansion
- Automated fulfillment
- Advanced EV tuning
- Fraud detection tooling
